# Hackathon

Code produced for Raman spectrum visulaisation and analysis contained in the Functions.pynb file. 

Backgroud_Fit - includes the workings for background fits for a single dataset to demostrate the developmet of the functions. 
KRICT2024_Hackathon_Gaussian - includes the workings for constructing the peak finding and Gaussian fitting functions as well as integrated intensities. 
Loop - loops the Gaussian fit through multiple datasets
Funnctions - the final notebook is the full code, with both functions and loops integrated to allow multiple datasets to be visualised and analysed and can be adapted accordingly. 

Intensity data used in this particular example included as a .xlsx file.
